#Aurora #Storage 

- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced).
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database).
- Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS.
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128 TB.
- Aurora can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10 ms replica lag).
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It’s HA (High Availability) native.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient.
