#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

Productivity and efficiency are major benefactors of digital transformation and data-driven cultures. Organizations that adopt digital systems and automate processes often see significant improvement in output per employee. By implementing systems and processes that reduce toil and repetitive tasks, people can focus their time and energy on tasks more suited for human beings, such as creativity, critical thinking, and innovation.

As organizations transitioned from typewriters to personal computers, the amount of time it took to write letters was significantly reduced. We transitioned from physical mail to email, where messages were sent and received at the speed of light with the click of a button. Tasks that could’ve taken weeks to orchestrate and execute can now be completed in a matter of hours or minutes. 

For example, working on a presentation may require collaboration across several different business units. In a non-digital world, this collaboration would require the coordination of multiple teams as they refine their content and work to deliver a cohesive narrative to the leadership team. This may mean hours of meetings as folks build out the presentation and get feedback from their respective teams and leadership before ultimately finalizing the content.

In the world of today, using cloud-native tools such as Google Workspace, you can create a slide deck, assign sections of it to different teams, and dynamically collaborate over the internet. 

If teams don’t overlap time zones, they can even add comments to other sections of the presentation and ensure that their feedback is taken into consideration. Not only is information more easily accessible, but this creates an environment where collaboration becomes effortless and tools are leveraged to lubricate the interaction of different teams.
