## Problem

A company's e-commerce application becomes slow when traffic spikes. The application has a three-tier architecture (web, application and database tier) that uses synchronous transactions. The development team at the company has identified certain bottlenecks in the application tier and it is looking for a long term solution to improve the application's performance.

As a developer associate, what solution would you suggest to meet the required application response times while accounting for any traffic spikes?

## Solution

**Leverage horizontal scaling for the web and application tiers by using Auto Scaling groups and Application Load Balancer**Â - A horizontally scalable system is one that can increase capacity by adding more computers to the system. This is in contrast to a vertically scalable system, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage.

Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers.

Elastic Load Balancing is used to automatically distribute your incoming application traffic across all the EC2 instances that you are running. You can use Elastic Load Balancing to manage incoming requests by optimally routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed.

To use Elastic Load Balancing with your Auto Scaling group, you attach the load balancer to your Auto Scaling group to register the group with the load balancer. Your load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group.

When you use Elastic Load Balancing with your Auto Scaling group, it's not necessary to register individual EC2 instances with the load balancer. Instances that are launched by your Auto Scaling group are automatically registered with the load balancer. Likewise, instances that are terminated by your Auto Scaling group are automatically deregistered from the load balancer.

This option will require fewer design changes, it's mostly configuration changes and the ability for the web/application tier to be able to communicate across instances. Hence, this is the right solution for the current use case.
