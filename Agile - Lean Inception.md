#Agile #LeanInception

An inception is an activity done at the start of a project to gather together the people involved and set a common direction and working style for the on-going work. The lean inception is a focused form of inception, which can be done in a single week. During this time we understand the key features and customers for the product, and build a canvas to formulate the characteristics of a Minimum Viable Product.

## Inception, the beginning of an agile project

Naive agile has no up-front work, but in practice we realize we have to do some. For Thoughtworks, _Inception_ is that "some". Since I joined Thoughtworks in 2006, I realized all agile projects in the company started in a similar way. The project team would get together for a few weeks, going through many activities prior to starting the delivery work: this was the inception.

The Thoughtworks inception was primarily developed by **Luke Barrett** around 2004. Jonathan Rasmusson (author of [The Agile Samurai](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356581/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356581&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20)) and Jeff Patton (author of [User Story Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491904909/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1491904909&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20)) both worked at Thoughtworks for a while, and they described and further developed inception techniques in their books, from which I learned a lot.

Our inceptions vary from project to project, but they usually generate alignment between the business and the technical people, and create an ordered list of user stories with estimates together with a release plan.

And I was very satisfied facilitating these agile inceptions this way until 2011, the year my son was born. The thing is, I was the inception facilitator, but the inception would take from two to four weeks. And I could not stay away from home for more than a week. I had to make the inceptions leaner, somehow make them fit in one week.

I was going on my first trip after my son was born. On a long flight from São Paulo to San Francisco I read [the Lean StartUp book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20) from Eric Ries. From it I found the perfect excuse to reduce the inception length, and return home after one week.
