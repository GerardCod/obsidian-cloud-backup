#Redhat #Linux 

Fedora is a community project that produces and releases a free, comprehensive Linux-based operating system. RedÂ Hat sponsors and works with the Fedora community to integrate the latest upstream software into a fast-moving, secure distribution. The Fedora project contributes back to the open source world, and anyone can participate.

Fedora prioritizes innovation and excellence above long-term stability. Major updates occur every six months, and bring significant changes. Fedora supports releases for about a year, which means the latest two updates, making it less suited for supportable production use. Fedora remains the source of innovation for the entire Enterprise Linux ecosystem. In general, packages start out in Fedora and are included into CentOS Stream only when they are considered mature in stability, security, performance, and customer demand.
