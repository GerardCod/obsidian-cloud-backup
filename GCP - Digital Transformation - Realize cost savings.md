#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

The result of implementing digital systems and modern ways of doing business across people, processes, and technology also results in cost savings. Paper-based processes are often cumbersome and expensive, requiring significant human work and can be very slow. 

These challenges can be overcome by implementing technology to automate away process complexity and cost. For example, through paper processes, it may take weeks to generate, validate, issue, and execute a contract. You have to engage multiple teams to put the paperwork together, validate that what is generated will pass integrity checks, and have the appropriate provisions. 

From there, you may have to mail or fax a contract to someone and hope that someone is on the other end to pick it up and put it through the appropriate process. 

Through a digital system, however, you can automate the specific contractual requirements to have them generated with the click of a button and issued for signature – within hours rather than weeks.

There are many benefits to transforming digitally, ranging from realizing cost savings, solving business problems, and breaking down silos to more technical reasons such as modernizing infrastructure, managing data, and gaining insight from that data.
