## Problem

Your team-mate has configured an Amazon S3 event notification for an S3 bucket that holds sensitive audit data of a firm. As the Team Lead, you are receiving the SNS notifications for every event in this bucket. After validating the event data, you realized that few events are missing.

What could be the reason for this behavior and how to avoid this in the future?

## Solution

**If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent**Â - Amazon S3 event notifications are designed to be delivered at least once. Typically, event notifications are delivered in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer.

If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent. If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket. With versioning, every successful write will create a new version of your object and will also send event notification.
