When an organization leverages the **public cloud**, it offloads much of the physical responsibility of operating a data center to a third party. 

**Google Cloud** is a public cloud platform where developers and engineers can access infrastructure built on top of Google’s data centers and networks. This enables businesses to offload responsibilities such as building and managing the physical components of the data center to specialize in what will provide value to their customers. 

Customers of public cloud providers benefit by abstracting away much of the complexity of managing technology infrastructure by focusing on the virtualization layer and above. 

This means being responsible for the virtual machines, operating systems, applications, and data to operate their businesses.
