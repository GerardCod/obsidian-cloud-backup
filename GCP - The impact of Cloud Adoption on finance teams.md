The transformation of organization towards public cloud adoption not only impacts technology departments but finance an legal teams as well.

Such impact is clear when instead of spending a lot of capital for private cloud infrastructure (hardware adquisition, securing physical data centers, connecting on-premise centers with internet to go global, etc).

With the rise of public cloud providers companies, and organizations have seen the shift from paying upfront for on-premise infrastructure to a pay-as-you-go model for all the infrastructure running their workloads with all the advantages that public cloud provide.

It’s important to keep in mind that all of the preceding implications mean that the **total cost of ownership** (**TCO**) of cloud environments can often end up being less – even if you end up having to pay a bit more for modern technologies. 

When you factor in the total cost of building, managing, and operating your infrastructure, it means millions of dollars across real estate, power, and people costs. 

From there, you also need to ensure your infrastructure is reliable and secure, which requires even more investment. By abstracting away the physical components of technology infrastructure and empowering organizations to do it all virtually, over the internet, public cloud providers take on much of the cost burdens associated with maintaining those kinds of environments while passing on the benefits of procuring and building data centers on a global scale.
