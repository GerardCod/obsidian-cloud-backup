#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

There are many benefits to transforming a business so that it can leverage the latest advances in computing, software, and data technologies. Whether it’s launching new products or building new capabilities into an existing business, the technology space is ever evolving and the pace of innovation seems to be increasing. Companies that have implemented or were born digital as cloud-native companies have a significant advantage over those that haven’t.

Whether it’s going from a monolithic application architecture that struggles to serve global clients to containers, Kubernetes, and global service orchestration, or the adoption of a data warehouse to empower analytics use cases, organizations that embrace a new way of doing things can make the most of new technologies as they quickly learn, test, validate and adopt them.
