#Agile #DesignSprint 

Of course, you may need to sell the idea of running a Design Sprint in the first place. If that's the case, try sharing a quick overview of the process with the [90 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2vSQPh6MCE), ["Stop Brainstorming"](https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/stop-brainstorming-start-sprinting) post, and/or this page you're looking at right now.  
  
You also might help the team experience a structured meeting with a 30-60 minute [Lightning Decision Jam](https://medium.muz.li/a-super-simple-exercise-for-solving-almost-any-product-design-challenge-f9e6c0019d7d) exercise. It's a great way to give teams a taste of the Design Sprint process before the full commitment.  
  
Or you could just drop some names: In addition to Google, Design Sprints have been run by teams at Slack, Uber, Airbnb, Medium, Dropbox, Facebook, McKinsey, IDEO, LEGO, the United Nations, the New York Times, and many, many more.  
  
Most importantly, get timing and tone right. Make sure the team is starting a big challenge and it's an [opportune moment to sprint](https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/how-do-i-know-if-its-the-right-time-to-run-a-design-sprint). And offer the Design Sprint as a way to be helpful with solving that challenge. If the timing isn't right, don't force it. If you're patient and helpful, the time will come.#
