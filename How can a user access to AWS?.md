#Security #IAM 

- To access AWS, you have three options:  
	- AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)  
	- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): protected by access keys  
	- AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys
- Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console 
- Users manage their own access keys  
- Access Keys are secret, just like a password. Don’t share them 
- Access Key ID ~= username  
- Secret Access Key ~= password
