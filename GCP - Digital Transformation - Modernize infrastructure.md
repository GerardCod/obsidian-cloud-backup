#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

Companies that transform digitally and adopt cloud-native ways of architecting systems can meaningfully optimize their hardware and software usage.

By migrating away from building and managing infrastructure themselves, they can quickly and easily build systems that have evolved from the traditional, server-based architecture to more modern, service-based architecture or even serverless systems. 

These systems allow their engineers to automate much of the day-to-day tasks of operating and managing infrastructure through features such as auto-scaling, which dynamically scales the infrastructure up and down based on load.

They also allow for global traffic routing, ensuring that customers have the best experience based on their geography and minimizing the time and effort required to build systems that scale globally.
