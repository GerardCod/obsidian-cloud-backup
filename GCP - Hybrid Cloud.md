#GCP 

A company that operates **hybrid cloud** environments blends both public and private cloud environments. They may have their own data centers hosting internal or sensitive applications while leveraging the public cloud for externally facing applications. 

This pattern is common in organizations that built up their own data centers and are building new applications in the cloud or are migrating systems to optimize for the most efficient hosting strategy. 

In some cases, they may build a data warehouse in the cloud to consolidate and organize data from disparate on-premises systems such as sales, marketing, logistics, and fulfillment data.
