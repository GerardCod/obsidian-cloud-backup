Depending on the circumstances, the destination may be Google’s major data centers or a **network edge data center**. Infrastructure at the edge of the network is quite common when content needs to be delivered with low latency. The edge refers to infrastructure that brings computing and data as close to the end user as possible. 

This allows better response times and therefore performance relative to centralized, data center infrastructure. If you work at a sports stadium, this may mean hosting infrastructure at the stadium that can process the sports video feed in real time to generate highlights and snapshots.

**Latency** is typically measured in milliseconds and is essentially the measure of how long it takes for data to travel from one point to another. If you want to watch the latest TV show that is very popular on your favorite streaming platform, that platform is likely hosting that content in an edge location to improve your experience. 

Video and image files for example are very large files and can take a long time to transmit from the centralized data center to the end user. By storing some commonly used data at the edge, such as a very popular TV show, a streaming platform would be able to avoid connectivity or latency issues with its content and provide a better consumer experience. 

They would also save on the cost related to transmitting the data from the central repository of content to the end user by routing that traffic to the edge location. Another common term related to networking performance is bandwidth. **Bandwidth** refers to how much traffic or data can be transferred over a network within a window of time. It is measured in **bits per second** (**BPS**) and designates the volume of data that can be transmitted via a specific cable or network.

For example, applications that stream content such as high-quality videos may require a connection with at least 3 GB per hour in bandwidth per person, while a gaming application may require 100 MB per hour per person.

Now that we have a better understanding of how networks function as a whole, let’s explore how Google’s proprietary global network impacts Google Cloud.
