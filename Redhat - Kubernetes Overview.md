Kubernetes is an orchestration service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. It manages complex pools of resources, such as CPU, RAM, storage, and networking. Kubernetes provides high uptime and fault tolerance for containerized application deployments, removing the concern that developers might have regarding how their applications use resources.

The smallest manageable unit in Kubernetes is a pod, which represents a single application and consists of one or more containers, including storage resources and an IP address.
