#GCP #Software_as_a_Service

**SaaS** is a cloud computing service model that provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use. SaaS products are completely managed by the service provider and come ready to use, including all updates, bug fixes, and overall maintenance. Most SaaS applications are accessed directly through a web browser, which means customers don’t have to download or install anything on their devices.

The SaaS revolution completely changed how organizations and their teams were able to use applications. Rather than having to rely on their infrastructure and teams to serve an application from inside their private cloud, they were able to access an application through the internet. 

This had a profound impact on how accessible technology became within organizations as they were able to cast off the shackles of complex internal processes and easily leverage new technology. 

Software providers also benefited greatly from this approach given that they were able to get their technology directly in the hands of end users across the globe without first having to navigate physical procurement challenges.
