#GCP #Platform 

Examples of Google Cloud’s PaaS services are App Engine and the Vertex AI platform. App Engine is an application hosting and management platform that allows developers to deploy code while completely abstracting away much of the infrastructure management. 

There is no need to build, launch, and manage VMs and operating systems. Developers simply deploy code and press launch. App Engine dynamically spins up infrastructure on the backend to handle the demand on the infrastructure and can scale it up and down based on the traffic. 

An example of a company using App Engine to scale quickly is Snap. When originally launching **Snapchat**, the social media sensation of the 2010s, the application had a monolithic architecture and was deployed on App Engine. 

According to the Snap engineering blog (you can read it at [https://eng.snap.com/monolith-to-multicloud-microservices-snap-service-mesh](https://eng.snap.com/monolith-to-multicloud-microservices-snap-service-mesh)), the benefit of App Engine was that it was able to accommodate rapid growth in features, engineers, and customers.
