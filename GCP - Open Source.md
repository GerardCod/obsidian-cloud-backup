Another concept that goes hand in hand with cloud-native is **open source**, as it relates to how software is developed and the accompanying standards with this shift. Historically, software has been _closed source_, meaning that the code base was owned and only viewable by the manufacturer. This led to a rise in enterprise software licensing where things such as **vendor lock-in** come into play, where you are at the mercy of the manufacturer from both a cost and capability perspective, locked into multi-year contracts, and unable to implement nor change the code base based on your needs.

In contrast, open source within the realm of software takes the opposite approach. Code bases are public, and anyone from around the world can view and contribute to the code base to ensure it meets their needs. Given this novel, distributed approach to software development, there were also requirements around policies that govern what would qualify as an open source project.

Some of the key principles to open source software development are as follows:

- Transparency, allowing public access to review and deploy the code
- Open, community-centric, and collaborative development
- Meritocratic approach to contribution, driven by experts
- Freely available without licensing or cost restrictions

Organizations that adopt the open source approach to software development can accelerate the pace of innovation for their teams given that they are not at the mercy of one company to improve the code base. Employees from the organization can make feature requests, contribute to the code base, and ensure that the code improves over time.
