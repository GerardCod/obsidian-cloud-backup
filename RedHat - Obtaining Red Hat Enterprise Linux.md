#Redhat #Linux 

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is typically obtained with a paid support subscription, and Red Hat provides multiple ways to obtain RHEL and other RHEL ecosystem products, many without cost.

- _Fedora Linux_ and derivatives are freely available from the Fedora project at [https://﻿getfedora.org/](https://getfedora.org/), including an emerging version of Fedora CoreOS.
- _EPEL_ and _EPEL Next_ packages are freely available from the EPEL project repositories. Learn how to use EPEL at [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/).
- _CentOS Stream_ is freely available at [https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/).

#### RHEL Evaluation Download
An evaluation copy of RHEL is available at [https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation). You must have a (free) Customer Portal account for [https://﻿access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com/) to access and download evaluation products. Product evaluations entitle you to receive updates and support for a limited period. Support ends when the evaluation period ends, but the evaluation software continues to operate. Additional information for many product evaluations is found on the Customer Portal evaluation pages.

#### Red Hat Developer Subscription
Red Hat provides a freely available subscription for many products through the Red Hat Developer Program at [https://developer.redhat.com](https://developer.redhat.com/). With a Developer subscription, developers can quickly create, prototype, test, and demonstrate their applications on the same Red Hat software as on production systems. Create a personal account at [https://access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com/), and then register for the Developer program. You can use an existing personal account, but do not use an account that is already associated with any organization's support subscription. The Developer subscription is self-supported, but provides ongoing product updates. Red Hat recommends that individuals who want to gain experience with RHEL and developer products should join the Developer Program.

#### Public Cloud Platforms
The major hyperscale public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, offer official images for deploying Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances, with subscription management from the Red Hat Cloud Access service. Fully entitled subscriptions for RHEL and Red Hat products are available through the cloud provider, and are portable in hybrid and multi-vendor clouds.

#### Containers
You can use Red Hat Universal Base Images and associated content for development and deployment without a Red Hat subscription. For operational support and access to non-UBI tools, containers that are built on UBI must be deployed on a Red Hat-supported platform such as OpenShift or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Access to non-UBI content requires a Red Hat subscription.
