### TCO

The TCO for SaaS solutions is regarded as the lowest of the different cloud hosting models. Although it may seem more expensive at face value given the licensing cost associated with these solutions, when you take into account the amount of time and effort in building, launching, and maintaining the infrastructure for hosting those systems, the costs are relatively low. SaaS applications tend to be business-facing or consumer-facing and may have significant fluctuations in traffic over time.

### Flexibility

The SaaS model is the least flexible of all the cloud models. Given that the provider is delivering an application directly to the end user, you are restricted by that application’s dependencies, code, and capabilities. You are essentially forced to adopt the limits of the application and its underlying infrastructure; you have no control over it or its security controls. There is typically minimal customization of the application, if at all possible, and issues around integration with existing tools and systems can become an issue. That being said, it’s very easy to use and get started, so there are many benefits to using SaaS systems as well.

### Shared responsibilities

Within the shared responsibility model, the SaaS provider is responsible for the entire technology stack from the underlying hardware, up to and including the application code. Clients are responsible for setting up the system and managing the data within the system but the rest is abstracted away. Again, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, let’s review the breakdown:

- SaaS vendor responsibilities:
    - Hardware
    - Virtualization
    - Operating system
    - Runtime
    - Scaling
    - Application
- SaaS customer responsibilities:
    - Data and configuration

### Management level

From a management perspective, the SaaS provider delivers an application over the internet to your end users and the only control you have over the environment as a client is the data that you upload to it and how the system is configured. Things such as infrastructure optimization, scaling, and managing the application code are abstracted away as the systems are designed for business use. The tradeoff is that users will be limited by the functionality of the system and won’t have direct control or influence over the application itself. Any changes to infrastructure or new features must go through the SaaS provider as they will be the ones managing the underlying components of the technology stack.

### Staffing and expertise

Technology teams that can leverage SaaS solutions for their business can specialize in system engineers. Given that they no longer need to focus specifically on managing infrastructure or development, they focus on being experts in the systems they implement to ensure they are properly configured and driving the value that the business expects. Examples of this are folks who become **customer relationship management** (**CRM**) system administrators or Google Workspace administrators. They develop skills around how to implement, manage, and secure the system based on its configurations.

While IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are all common hosting models, depending on the application that you are using, new models for hosting technology in the cloud have also been developed. Providers are exploring different levels of abstraction to where customers may need more control of the environment than in a PaaS environment but not as much control as in an IaaS environment. Similarly, perhaps you need more control over an application than in a SaaS solution but not as much as you would have with a PaaS environment. Let’s explore additional variations of the shared responsibility model.
