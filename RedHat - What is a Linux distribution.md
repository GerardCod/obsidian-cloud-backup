A _Linux distribution_ is an installable operating system that is constructed from a Linux kernel and that supports user programs and libraries. A complete _Linux_ system is developed by multiple independent development communities that work cooperatively on individual components. A distribution provides an easy method to install and manage a working Linux system.

In 1991, graduate student Linus Torvalds developed a UNIX-like kernel that he named Linux, and licensed it as open source software under the GPL. The kernel is the core of the operating system and manages hardware, memory, and the scheduling of running programs. The Linux kernel is supplemented with other open source software, including utilities and programs from the GNU Project, a graphical interface from MIT's _X Window System_. The Linux kernel also includes other open source components, such as the Sendmail mail server and the Apache HTTP web server, to become a complete open source UNIX-like operating system.

A major challenge for Linux users is to assemble all these software pieces from many sources. Early Linux developers provided a distribution of prebuilt and tested tools that users could download and install to quickly implement Linux systems.

Many Linux distributions exist, each with differing goals and support criteria. Generally, distributions have some common characteristics:

- Distributions consist of a Linux kernel and support user-space programs.
- Distributions can be small and single-purpose, or can include thousands of open source programs.
- Distributions provide a means to install and update the software and its components.
- The distribution provider supports the software, and ideally, participates in the development community.
