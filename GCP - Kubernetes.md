A great example of a successful open source project is **Kubernetes**. Kubernetes is an open source software project launched by Google as a way to help drive awareness of container-based deployment methods and architecture.

Containers were a new way of thinking about how to run applications as they relate to the underlying hardware and software. In the world of virtual machines, the application, operating system, and hardware are fundamentally coupled. This means that if the hardware fails, the application also fails. Containers allowed developers to scale applications more gracefully and build more fault tolerance into their architecture and systems. It also happened to be a more cost-effective way of hosting applications given that resources could be shared across several systems to ensure maximum utilization while minimizing cost.

This shift in designing and architecting systems translated very well to cloud-native organizations, given their flexibility and ability to rapidly innovate. More traditional organizations began to adopt similar practices as they began to comprehend the value that these approaches can deliver to their business, with start-ups rising quickly and disrupting industry after industry.

The shift from private to public cloud, by offloading the responsibilities of building and managing data centers, has enabled businesses to focus on driving change that has a meaningful impact on the bottom line. Engineers who had historically been tasked with monitoring onsite infrastructure or managing databases can be repurposed to increase developer productivity, improve the security posture, or engage in R&D projects.

As we explore the forces behind why businesses have been shifting to public cloud adoption, it’s helpful to start by defining digital transformation, including its importance and benefits.
