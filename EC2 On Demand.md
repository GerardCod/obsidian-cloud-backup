#EC2 #Billing 

- Pay for what you use:  
    • Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute • All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
