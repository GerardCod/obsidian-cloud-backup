#GCP #Networking 

The website request, after being translated into an IP address, will go from your home or office to an **internet service provider** (**ISP**), which will then route the traffic to the destination. 

ISPs are essentially the backbone of what we call the internet – they are a series of globally distributed companies that have built out a network of high-speed **fiber optic cables** to serve their clients. 

The internet is essentially a web of distributed networks, owned and managed by these ISPs. Fiber optic cables use light to transmit information, making it extremely fast and less susceptible to interference relative to copper cables. 

Between large, regional ISPs, some of which may be an ocean apart, you’ll find **subsea cables** connecting them to form the global internet we think of today. To get internet traffic from North America to Europe, Africa, or Asia, you must first build the networking infrastructure across the Atlantic or Pacific oceans.
