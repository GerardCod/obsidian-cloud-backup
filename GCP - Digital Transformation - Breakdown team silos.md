The transition from paper to digital also facilitates productivity and collaboration for teams across geographies. Employees can easily find, access, share, and collaborate on files and projects at the speed of light rather than being at the mercy of paper-based processes.

Customers also benefit from this as the teams that they work with can deliver more value faster relative to competitors who don’t adopt modern practices. A marketing team in India, for example, might need to update a campaign for the local market. 

With a digital cloud-based system, a team in the US can quickly and easily upload all of the raw marketing files to a shared drive where the India team can access it to make the appropriate updates, all with the click of a button.
