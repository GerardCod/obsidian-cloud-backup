Digital systems not only allow you to more easily and efficiently manage data but also facilitate the act of deriving value from the data. 

Companies can adopt new approaches to sharpen the focus of their business on their core value, applying things such as machine learning to provide more value to their customers and generate new revenue streams. 

Business leaders can also be empowered to make better decisions through higher fidelity real-time data, which gives them a better understanding of the current state of the business and what challenges it faces.
