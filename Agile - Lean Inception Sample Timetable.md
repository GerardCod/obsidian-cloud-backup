#Agile #LeanInception 

The lean inception consists of a series of activities, typically scheduled over the course of a week. I'll explain each activity in the following timetable links:

|Friday|[Build the MVP Canvas](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/build-mvp-canvas.html)|Showcase the results of the inception to those interested in the project|

This is an example timetable, please don't treat it as a fixed thing, but let it serve as a good example for how things might flow.

We start the inception with an introduction and kick off, and finish with a showcase. In an ideal world, everyone would be present for the whole inception. However, we usually have people who are very much interested in the direction and result of the inception but aren't able to spend full time on the effort. The minimum necessary is that these stakeholders attend the introduction, kick-off and showcase sessions.
