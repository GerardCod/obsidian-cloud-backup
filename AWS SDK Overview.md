#Development #SDK

- We have to use the AWS SDK when coding against AWS Services such as DynamoDB
- Fun fact... the AWS CLI uses the Python SDK (boto3)
- The exam expects you to know when you should use an SDK
- We’ll practice the AWS SDK when we get to the Lambda functions
- Good to know: if you don’t specify or configure a default region, then us-east-1 will be chosen by default
