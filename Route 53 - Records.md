• How you want to route traffic for a domain
• Each record contains:  
• Domain/subdomain Name – e.g., example.com  
• Record Type – e.g., A or AAAA  
• Value – e.g., 12.34.56.78  
• Routing Policy – how Route 53 responds to queries  
• TTL – amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers
• Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
- (must know)A /AAAA / CNAME / NS
