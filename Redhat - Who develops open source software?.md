Open source development today is overwhelmingly professional. Open source is no longer solely developed by a body of volunteers. Today, most open source developers work for organizations that pay them to participate with open source projects to construct and contribute the enhancements that the organization and their customers need.

Volunteers and the academic community still play a significant role and can make vital contributions, especially in emerging technology. The combination of formal and informal development provides a highly dynamic and productive environment.
