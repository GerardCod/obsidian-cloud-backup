#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

 The rise of data-driven cultures within organizations is also required for a full digital transformation. This means that people within the organization are willing to invest the time and energy required to implement the appropriate systems, manage them with operational excellence, and deliver value across the company.

An organization that has a strong, data-driven culture will have senior leaders who are committed to making decisions using data and creating a culture where data is valued and used across the organization. Their teams will have data literacy – a basic understanding of what data is made available across the organization and how it should be used. This includes adopting best practices for how to collect, clean, and interpret data and implementing governance controls to ensure that data is accurate, reliable, and accessible where it’s appropriate.

Data-driven culture affords organizations several advantages; they can make better decisions, improve efficiency and productivity, identify new opportunities, reduce risk, and gain competitive advantages.
