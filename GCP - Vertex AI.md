#GCP #Platform 

The Vertex AI platform provides a development environment for data and ML teams to build, test, validate, launch, catalog, and iterate on ML models with ease. It’s built on top of Google’s recently launched practice of **machine learning operations** (**MLOps**), which outlines best practices for full life cycle model management. 

Some of the highlights of the platform are Vertex AI Workbench, a managed Jupyter notebook environment with pre-installed packages and integrations; Vertex 

AI Pipelines, which helps with ML workflow orchestration through serverless services; and Model Garden, a catalog of ML models provided by Google and its partners that can be used to kickstart ML projects. 

The head of ad tech for Wayfair, for example, highlights how the Vertex AI platform and the MLOps approach to ML reduces time to value for AI models for his company (you can read it here: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2021/11/29/3-steps-to-scale-ml-models-and-drive-more-business-impact/?sh=47a3f8693431](https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2021/11/29/3-steps-to-scale-ml-models-and-drive-more-business-impact/?sh=47a3f8693431)):

“We’re doing ML at a massive scale, and we want to make that easy. That means accelerating time-to-value for new models, increasing the reliability and speed of very large regular re-training jobs, and reducing the friction to build and deploy models at scale… Certain large model training jobs are 5-10x faster with Vertex AI, and it offers our data scientists hyperparameter tuning. This enables us to weave ML into the fabric of how we make decisions.”
