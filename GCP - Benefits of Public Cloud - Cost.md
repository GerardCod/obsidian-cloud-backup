Cost is also a significant factor that drives the adoption of public cloud environments. The amount of capital investment to get a physical, self-hosted, and managed environment off the ground is massive. Often, you have to procure capacity for potential future usage, and organizations are forced to spend millions of dollars on all the associated costs of building and running their data centers.

Between buying or leasing land, standing up, or renting a structure that meets the data center requirements, power, cooling, and headcount – these projects can take years to get off the ground and require massive capital expenditure.

In contrast, public cloud providers offer pay-as-you-go services that allow you to pay purely for the infrastructure that you use and some even provide tooling to help optimize the environment based on historical usage patterns. This helps organizations right-size their infrastructure and only pay for the capacity that they need rather than paying for hardware to sit on a shelf in the hopes that it may be needed someday.

The additional burden of having to harden and secure both the physical and digital components of the data center requires mature security teams, practices, and technologies – all of which increase the cost burden of building, running, and managing your infrastructure.

In summary, there are many factors why an organization would adopt public cloud. Whether they’re a fledgling startup that wants to build a global gaming company or a large regional bank that is looking to better serve clients in a digital age, the benefits, such as scalability, flexibility, reliability, agility, and cost, make a strong argument for adopting public cloud environments.
