_Open source software_ is software with _source code_ that anyone can use, study, modify, and share.

Source code is the set of human-readable instructions that are used to make a program. Code might be in interpretive form, such as a script, or compiled into a binary executable that the computer runs directly. Source code becomes copyrighted when created, and the copyright holder controls the terms under which the software can be copied, adapted, and distributed. Users can use the software according to its software license.

Some software uses "proprietary" or "closed source" source code that only the originating person, team, or organization can see, or change, or distribute. Proprietary licenses typically restrict the user to running the program, and provide limited or no access to the source.

Open source software is different. When a copyright holder provides software under an open source license, they grant the user the right to run the program and to view, modify, compile, and redistribute the source to others, royalty-free. Open source licensing promotes collaboration, sharing, transparency, and rapid innovation, because it encourages more people to modify and improve the software and to share enhancements more widely.

Open source software can still be provided for commercial use. Open source is a critical part of many organizations' commercial operations. Some open source licenses allow code to be reused in proprietary products. Anyone can sell open source code, but open source licensing generally allows the customer to redistribute the source code. Open source vendors such as Red Hat provide commercial support for deploying, managing, and building solutions that are based on open source products.

Open source has many benefits for the user:

- _Control_: See what the code does and improve it.
- _Training_: Learn from real-world code and develop more applications that are useful.
- _Security_: Inspect sensitive code, and fix it even without the original developers' help.
- _Stability_: Rely on code that can survive the loss of the original developer.
