The demands that come from customers are ever-evolving concerning developments in the market and associated technologies. By analyzing how customers prefer to engage, how they grow through their life cycle, and what needs arise throughout that journey, businesses can provide tailored experiences that meet and exceed customer expectations. They can find patterns and reasons why people leave the platform for example, identify the root cause(s), and implement a way to overcome those challenges proactively, thereby increasing retention and reducing churn.
