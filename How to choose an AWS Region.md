Some points to consider when choosing an AWS Region are:
- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- **Proximity** to customers: reduced latency  
- **Available services** within a Region: new services and new features arenâ€™t available in every Region?
- **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
