Linux is a critical technology for IT professionals to understand.

Linux is in widespread use, worldwide. Internet users interact with Linux applications and web server systems daily, by browsing the World Wide Web and using e-commerce sites to buy and sell products.

Linux is in use for much more than the internet. Linux manages point-of-sale systems and the world's stock markets, powers smart TVs and in-flight entertainment systems, and runs most of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Linux provides the core technologies that power the cloud revolution and the tools to build the latest generations of container-based microservices applications, software-based storage technologies, and big data solutions.
