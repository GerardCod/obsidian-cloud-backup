#Security #IAM #X-Ray

## Problem

Your company likes to operate multiple AWS accounts so that teams have their environments. Services deployed across these accounts interact with one another, and now there's a requirement to implement X-Ray traces across all your applications deployed on EC2 instances and AWS accounts.

## Solution

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components.

How X-Ray Works: ![](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Products/product-name/Images/product-page-diagram_AWS-X-Ray_how-it-works.2922edd4bfe011e997dbf32fdf8bd520bcbc85fb.png) via - [https://aws.amazon.com/xray/](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/)

**Create a role in the target unified account and allow roles in each sub-account to assume the role**

**Configure the X-Ray daemon to use an IAM instance role**

The X-Ray agent can assume a role to publish data into an account different from the one in which it is running. This enables you to publish data from various components of your application into a central account.

X-Ray can also track requests flowing through applications or services across multiple AWS Regions.
