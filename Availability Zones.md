An Availability Zone (**AZ**) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity. Some other concepts related are:

- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
	- ap-southeast-2a 
	-  ap-southeast-2b 
	- ap-southeast-2c
- They are separated from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
- Theyâ€™re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
