#Redhat #Linux 

A Fedora project Special Interest Group (SIG) builds and maintains a community-supported package repository called Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL). EPEL versions align with major RHEL releases, and enable RHEL customers to run workloads with software dependencies that are not supported in RHEL. EPEL packages are not included in Red Hat support, but are equivalent to Fedora's level of quality.

Typically, EPEL packages are built against RHEL releases. EPEL Next is an additional repository for package maintainers to build against CentOS Stream. This repository is useful when CentOS Stream contains an upcoming RHEL library rebase, or if an EPEL package has a minimum version build requirement that is already in CentOS Stream but not yet in RHEL.
