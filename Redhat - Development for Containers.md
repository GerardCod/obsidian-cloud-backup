Containerization provides many advantages for the development process, such as easier testing and deployments, by providing tools for stability, security, and flexibility.
#### Testing and Workflows

One of the greatest advantages of containers for developers is the ability to scale. A developer can write software and test locally, and then deploy the finished application to a cloud server or a dedicated cluster with few or no changes. This workflow is especially useful when creating microservices, which are small and ephemeral containers that are designed to spin up and down as needed. Additionally, developers that use containers can take advantage of _Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD)_ pipelines to deploy containers to various environments. In particular, RHOCP offers various integration features with CI/CD pipelines and workflows in mind.

#### Stability

As mentioned earlier, container images are a stable target for developers. Software applications require specific versions of libraries to be available for deployment, which can result in dependency issues or specific OS requirements. Because libraries are included in the container image, a developer can be confident of no dependency issues in a deployment. Having the libraries integrated within the container removes variability between testing and production environments. For example, a container with a specific version of Python ensures that the same version of Python is used in every testing or deployment environment.

#### Multicontainer applications

A multi-container application is distributed across several containers. You can run the containers from the same image for _high availability_ (HA) replicas, or from several different images. For example, a developer can create an application that includes a database container that runs separately from the application's web API container. An application can rely on the container management software to provide HA replicas with multi-container options, such as Podman Pods or the `compose-spec` specification.
