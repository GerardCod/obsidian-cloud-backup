**PaaS** is a cloud computing service model that delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop applications through the cloud. Developers and IT operations teams can use PaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform on their own. Customers still have to write the code and manage their data and applications, but the environment to build and deploy apps is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

In addition to SaaS and IaaS hosting models, there is also the PaaS model. PaaS solutions provide value to technology teams by abstracting away the need to manage infrastructure while allowing them to develop, host, and manage applications. 

This enables teams to invest less in infrastructure-focused technical headcount and more in development headcount, empowering them to build more code faster. 

If an organization’s core business is in software and application development, such tools are very powerful in helping them focus resources on building new features and delivering on product roadmaps. This focus allows them to maintain pace with and even out-innovate competitors who are less efficient with their headcount and resource allocation.
