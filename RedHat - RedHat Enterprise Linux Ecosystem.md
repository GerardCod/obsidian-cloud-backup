#Redhat #Linux 

_Red Hat Enterprise Linux_ (RHEL) is Red Hat's commercial production-grade Linux distribution. Red Hat develops and integrates open source software into RHEL through a multistage process.

- Red Hat _participates_ in supporting individual open source projects. It contributes code, developer time, resources, and support, and often collaborates with developers from other Linux distributions, to improve the general quality of software for everyone.
    
- Red Hat sponsors and _integrates_ open source projects into the community-driven Fedora distribution. Fedora provides a free working environment to serve as a development lab and proving ground for features to be incorporated into CentOS Stream and RHEL products.
    
- Red Hat _stabilizes_ the CentOS Stream software to be ready for long-term support and standardization, and integrates it into RHEL, the production-ready distribution.
