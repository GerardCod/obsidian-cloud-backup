**Multi-cloud** is a cloud computing strategy where companies use multiple public cloud providers to host their applications. This allows them to run their workloads optimally across multiple environments and vendors, reducing the risk that arises related to vendor lock-in, where organizations become restricted in their ability to innovate and negotiate cost when they consolidate their infrastructure under a single vendor. 

Managing environments across multiple cloud providers can be complex given the variations between the platforms and the potential required integrations.

Multi-cloud is becoming more common as engineers build skills across multiple providers and vendors begin to differentiate themselves through unique capabilities, partnerships, or contracting vehicles.
