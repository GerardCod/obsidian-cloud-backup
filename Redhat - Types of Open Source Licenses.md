The developers of open source software can license their software in different ways. The software license terms control how the source can be combined with other code or reused. To be open source, licenses must allow users to freely use, view, change, compile, and distribute the code.

Two general classes of open source license are particularly important:

- _Copyleft_ licenses are designed to encourage keeping the code open source.
- _Permissive_ licenses are designed to maximize code reusability.

Copyleft, or "share-alike" licenses, require that anyone who distributes the source code, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom for others to also copy, change, and distribute the code. The advantage of copyleft licenses is that they help to keep existing code, and improvements to that code, open and increase the amount of available open source code. Common copyleft licenses include the _GNU General Public License_ (GPL) and the _Lesser GNU Public License_ (LGPL).

Permissive licenses maximize the reusability of source code. You can use the source for any purpose if the copyright and license statements are preserved, including reusing code under more restrictive or proprietary licenses. Although permissive licensing makes it easy to reuse code, it risks encouraging proprietary-only enhancements. Examples of permissive licenses include the MIT/X11 license, the Simplified BSD license, and the Apache Software License 2.0.
