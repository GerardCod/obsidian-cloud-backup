#Development #API_Gateway #Lambda 

## Problem

A developer is creating a RESTful API service using an Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda integration. The service must support different API versions for testing purposes.

As a Developer Associate, which of the following would you suggest as the best way to accomplish this?

## Solution

**Deploy the API versions as unique stages with unique endpoints and use stage variables to provide the context to identify the API versions**Â - A stage is a named reference to a deployment, which is a snapshot of the API. You use a stage to manage and optimize a particular deployment. For example, you can configure stage settings to enable caching, customize request throttling, configure logging, define stage variables, or attach a canary release for testing.

Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API. They act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates.

With deployment stages in API Gateway, you can manage multiple release stages for each API, such as alpha, beta, and production. Using stage variables you can configure an API deployment stage to interact with different backend endpoints.

For example, your API can pass a GET request as an HTTP proxy to the backend web host (for example, http://example.com). In this case, the backend web host is configured in a stage variable so that when developers call your production endpoint, API Gateway calls example.com. When you call your beta endpoint, API Gateway uses the value configured in the stage variable for the beta stage, and calls a different web host (for example, beta.example.com). Similarly, stage variables can be used to specify a different AWS Lambda function name for each stage in your API.
