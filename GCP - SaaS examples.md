Examples of SaaS technologies from the Google Cloud ecosystem are Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Drive. 

Gmail is an email hosting service and one of the core components of Google Workspace, Google’s Enterprise productivity suite. 

Google Docs is a cloud-native document editor that leverages the strengths of the SaaS model by having documents accessible over the internet and multiple people to collaborate on them simultaneously. 

Google Drive is a web-based cloud data repository where users can upload any file type, such as documents, image files, or spreadsheets, to easily work on and access them if needed. These solutions or variations of them have often been the first exposure most people have to the cloud. 

These solutions also created new ways of working, where documents weren’t locked down to physical machines or hard drives and were accessible over the internet, all around the world. Folks were able to collaborate at a scale and speed that previously wouldn’t be possible.
