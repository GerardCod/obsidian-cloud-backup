#Security #IAM 

- Strong passwords = higher security for your account
- In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
	- Set a minimum password length
	- Require specific character types: • including uppercase letters  
	    • lowercase letters  
	    • numbers
	    • non-alphanumeric characters
    
	- Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
	- Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
	- Prevent password re-use
