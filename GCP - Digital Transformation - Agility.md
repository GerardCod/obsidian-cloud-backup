#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

Organizations are having to compete on a global scale with companies large and small to win new customers and retain existing ones. 

Through digital transformation, development teams are enabled to accelerate the pace at which they innovate while also being able to significantly increase the scale of their launches.

Rather than having to launch a service in a specific region or city due to process or technology constraints, businesses can now build once and launch anywhere through innovations such as global cloud providers and **Infrastructure as** **Code** (**IaC**).

There are many reasons for a business to transform from analog, paper-based processes to digital processes. Not only will employees be more productive, but they’ll be more innovative and make better decisions. 

Workflows that might’ve taken days, weeks, or months can be compressed into days, hours, or even seconds. A common anecdote for demonstrating the impact of failing to digitize is the story of Blockbuster. Blockbuster was a brick-and-mortar store where you would go to rent or buy movies and TV shows. The walls and floors were lined with shelves covered in empty VHS and DVD boxes highlighting which titles were available.

Many customers had come to cherish the experience of walking through those aisles, exploring interesting titles and genres until they finally found the one – and hoped it was in stock! Blockbuster, by 2004, had 9,000 stores globally (as per [https://www.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-is-closing-forever-2013-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-is-closing-forever-2013-11)) and earned $5.9 billion in revenue (as per [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1085734/000119312507239499/dex991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1085734/000119312507239499/dex991.htm)).

Fast forward to 2023 and you won’t find a Blockbuster anywhere as they were digitally disrupted by Netflix. They started by competing with Blockbuster through a video-mailing service, eliminating the need to go to a physical location and be at the mercy of what was in stock, but eventually moved onto cloud-based video streaming. 

Online video streaming created a new way to browse and consume content, where a customer had a massive library of titles at their fingertips. Customers began to expect to be able to watch the latest release from the comfort of their homes without having to worry about whether or not Blockbuster had that video in stock. 

Today, Netflix continues to be a successful company, having reached $8.1 billion in quarterly revenue for Q1 of 2023 (as per [https://www.statista.com/statistics/273883/netflixs-quarterly-revenue/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,the%20corresponding%20quarter%20of%202022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273883/netflixs-quarterly-revenue/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,the%20corresponding%20quarter%20of%202022)). They are now facing an innovation dilemma as they face intense competition from new services such as Disney+, Paramount+, and Max.

Now that we understand why organizations are transforming digitally, let’s explore the benefits of going through that transition.
