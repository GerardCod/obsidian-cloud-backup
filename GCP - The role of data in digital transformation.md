#GCP #DigitalTransformation 

The adoption of digital systems played a large role in ensuring that processes that may have been slow, laborious, and expensive were automated, empowering employees to be more productive and less prone to error.

Between the capacity for human error, constraints on the time and effort required to complete certain tasks, and the complexity of orchestrating human work with large, complex calculations, computers became the ultimate productivity machine.

Applications were developed that could visualize, manipulate, and publish data so that people could more easily interact with information. At their most basic level, all applications are data manipulation engines. They allow you to take data from somewhere, do something to it, and put it somewhere else. This pattern is repeated with additional complexity across applications but fundamentally, the purpose of all applications is to manipulate data.

Therefore, data is at the heart of digital transformation as the goal of digital transformation is to increase productivity, reduce costs, and create new streams of revenue.

## Examples

If your company is a gaming company, gaming applications take input data from users (keystrokes, mouse clicks, pressing a button on a gaming controller) and trigger specific events in the virtual world they’ve created. This means that whenever a player presses _X_ to speak to a character in a game, they are essentially accessing data that contains the conversation flow for that character based on the fact that they’ve met a certain set of conditions in a game.

If your company is in the financial services industry, your banking application organizes and visualizes data related to financial transactions for your customers. You visualize both credits and debits for them in their checking accounts, usually in real time, giving your customers full visibility into their current financial posture. The banking application visualizes information related to checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and potentially even vehicle and mortgage loans.

If your company is in the e-commerce industry, your e-commerce application surfaces product information for your clients and creates a virtual storefront from which they can see what inventory you have in stock, the cost of the inventory, and even how long it would take to make a shipment. All of these systems, such as product inventory, logistics, and pricing information, are fundamentally surfacing data that can be cross-referenced to provide a more accurate representation of reality.
