- When you call the AWS HTTP API, you sign the request so that AWS can identify you, using your AWS credentials (access key & secret key)
- Note: some requests to Amazon S3 donâ€™t need to be signed
- If you use the SDK or CLI, the HTTP requests are signed for you
- You should sign an AWS HTTP request using Signature v4 (SigV4)
