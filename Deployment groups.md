#Deployment #CodeDeploy 

## Problem

As a site reliability engineer, you are responsible for improving the company’s deployment by scaling and automating applications. As new application versions are ready for production you ensure that the application gets deployed to different sets of EC2 instances at different times allowing for a smooth transition.

Using AWS CodeDeploy, which of the following options will allow you to do this?

## Solution

**CodeDeploy Deployment Groups**

You can specify one or more deployment groups for a CodeDeploy application. The deployment group contains settings and configurations used during the deployment. Most deployment group settings depend on the compute platform used by your application. Some settings, such as rollbacks, triggers, and alarms can be configured for deployment groups for any compute platform.

In an EC2/On-Premises deployment, a deployment group is a set of individual instances targeted for deployment. A deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both.
