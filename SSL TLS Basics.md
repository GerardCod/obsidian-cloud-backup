#Encryption

- An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
- SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections
- TLS refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version
- Nowadays, TLS cer tificates are mainly used, but people still refer as SSL
- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA)
- Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc...
- SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and must be renewed
