#GCP #PublicCloud 

To compete in the fast-paced technology market of today, companies are focused on ensuring that they can maximize the productivity of their developers and teams. Engineering teams are very expensive from a headcount standpoint. Therefore, by maximizing the utilization and productivity of their engineer, an organization can ensure that they are matching or beating their competitors when it comes to building and launching features, products, and services.

With a private cloud environment, developers constantly run into technical blockers when trying to build, test, and launch code. Between requests for provisioning development environments, building and automating tests, and pushing to production, it can be very painful when developers have to work with other teams to get access to critical tools and systems.

Developers working on public cloud have the benefit of being significantly more agile given that they don’t have to run into physical restraints on building new environments for development, testing, and production deployments. With the click of a button or a set of API calls, a developer can quickly and easily spin up infrastructure, segment it out into _development_, _test_, and _production_ environments, and execute on their job. This feeds well into the practice of **Agile** software development as it makes it easier and faster for technology teams to collaborate and maximize productivity.
