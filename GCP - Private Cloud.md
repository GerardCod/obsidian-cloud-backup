Private cloud means an organization is responsible for maintainance and security of its own IT resources.

The company buys or leases land, manages the building, procures the servers, installs the operating systems, and manages the applications and data while also being responsible for both the physical and virtual security of the private cloud. 

In some circumstances, they may procure the space from a third-party vendor but they are ultimately responsible for the hardware, software, and networking infrastructure, with the space within the facility dedicated exclusively to them.

Some drawbacks of the private cloud are the requirements for large capital expenditure on real estate, equipment, and operating costs, as well as the deep complexity that comes along with having to design, build, maintain, secure, and scaleÂ their infrastructure.
