If someone asks you "What makes Linux great?", then you have many answers to pick from:

- **Linux is _open source_ software.**
    Being open source means that you can see all of how a program or system works. You can also experiment with changes and share them freely for others to use. The open source model means that improvements are easier to make, enabling faster innovation.
    
- **Linux provides a _command-line interface_ (CLI) for easy access and powerful scripting.**
    Linux is built around a basic design philosophy that users can perform all administration tasks from the CLI. It enables easier automation, deployment, and provisioning, and simplifies both local and remote system administration. Unlike many other operating systems, these capabilities were in the architecture from the start, and result in ease of use and stability.
    
- **Linux is a _modular_ operating system that is designed to easily replace or remove components.**
    System components can be upgraded and updated when needed. A Linux system can be a general-purpose development workstation or a purposefully minimized software appliance.
