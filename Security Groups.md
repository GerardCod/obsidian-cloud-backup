- Security groups only contain rules  
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

## **Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances**

They regulate:  
- Access to Ports  
- Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6  
- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)  
- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)
