#Agile #LeanInception 

This new inception style is definitely a shift from the 2006 inception. The team doesn't write and estimate user stories anymore. While experimenting with this new style, the name inception gave everyone the wrong message. I needed a different name.

The new inception style is lean for two reasons:

1. the inception duration is shorter, removing everything which was not about the product (such as architecture, project, etc), making it _lean_
2. the end result of the inception is the understanding the MVP, a main concept from the _Lean_ StartUp movement.

Therefore the new inception style had a clear leading name: _The Lean Inception_.
