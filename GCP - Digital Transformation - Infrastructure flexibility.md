In the world of physical data centers, capacity planning and availability can be a big blocker. Having a server procured, shipped, configured, and pushed online can take days, weeks, or even months, depending on the circumstances.

One of the big advantages of working with a cloud provider is that machines of all shapes and sizes are available through the click of a button. Spinning up a server, whether it’s in the US, Europe, or Asia, is a trivial workflow that makes it very easy to spin up servers virtually, deploy them, and manage them.

It’s all done through a secure internet connection and if you decide that you no longer need something, you can spin it down to effectively stop paying for it.
