#Development #RDS 

## Problem

The development team at a health-care company is planning to migrate to AWS Cloud from the on-premises data center. The team is evaluating Amazon RDS as the database tier for its flagship application.

Which of the following would you identify as correct for RDS Multi-AZ?

## Solution

**RDS applies OS updates by performing maintenance on the standby, then promoting the standby to primary, and finally performing maintenance on the old primary, which becomes the new standby**

Running a DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment can further reduce the impact of a maintenance event because Amazon RDS applies operating system updates by following these steps:

Perform maintenance on the standby.

Promote the standby to primary.

Perform maintenance on the old primary, which becomes the new standby.

When you modify the database engine for your DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment, then Amazon RDS upgrades both the primary and secondary DB instances at the same time. In this case, the database engine for the entire Multi-AZ deployment is shut down during the upgrade.

**Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the standby, in case the primary database fails for any reason**Â - You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running your DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment. If an Availability Zone failure or DB instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete.

Another implied benefit of running your DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment is that DB instance failover is automatic and requires no administration. In an Amazon RDS context, this means you are not required to monitor DB instance events and initiate manual DB instance recovery in the event of an Availability Zone failure or DB instance failure.
