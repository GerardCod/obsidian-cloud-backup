#Development #CloudFormation 

## Problem

As an AWS Certified Developer Associate, you are writing a CloudFormation template in YAML. The template consists of an EC2 instance creation and one RDS resource. Once your resources are created you would like to output the connection endpoint for the RDS database.

Which intrinsic function returns the value needed?

## Solution

AWS CloudFormation provides several built-in functions that help you manage your stacks. Intrinsic functions are used in templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime.

**`!GetAtt`**Â - The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns the value of an attribute from a resource in the template. This example snippet returns a string containing the DNS name of the load balancer with the logical name myELB - YML : !GetAtt myELB.DNSName JSON : "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "myELB" , "DNSName" ]
