CentOS Stream is the upstream project for RHEL. Development of the next RHEL version is transparent and open for community contributions that can directly influence the next release. Patches that are submitted to CentOS Stream are integrated faster to RHEL, to allow significant changes during the current RHEL version lifecycle. CentOS Stream is a continuous integration and delivery distribution, with tested and stable nightly builds.

The CentOS project welcomes contributors worldwide, to give RHEL derivatives the opportunity to contribute to CentOS Stream for their own benefit. The CentOS project also aims to promote sustainable open source software that responds faster to security exploits, emerging technologies, and changing customer requirements.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Before 2019, CentOS Linux was a freely available, unsupported distribution, community-built from Red Hat's source code after each major RHEL release. Although the CentOS community enjoyed having a freely available RHEL clone, this model had disadvantages. Commonly, developer contributions to CentOS Linux were not backported to Fedora or RHEL without considerable duplicate effort. </mark>

> [!Note]
> Also, significant delays occurred between a RHEL release and its corresponding CentOS distribution build, with a similar delay for critical RHEL security, driver, and tuning fixes. Red Hat switched to the CentOS Stream model to address these issues.

A benefit of CentOS Stream is that, as the source for RHEL development, it is available in all the same architectures as RHEL, including Intel/AMD x86_64, ARM64, IBM Power, and IBM Z.

Many innovative technology organizations have proven that CentOS Stream is a viable replacement for the original downstream CentOS Linux. CentOS Stream can be freely downloaded and installed for many use cases, including development and light production. For community users with use cases that are not suitable for a continuously delivered distribution with asynchronous patch releases, Red Hat provides free individual RHEL developer subscriptions for small-scale use, such as demos, prototyping, quality assurance, and limited production.
