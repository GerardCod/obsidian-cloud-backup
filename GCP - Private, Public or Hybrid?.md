Organizations that already have invested in their infrastructure and acquired hardware, software licenses and more, with the goal to extend their applications and workloads while maintaining control over data for some applications because regulatory reasons would prefer a **Hybrid Model**.

But some organizations would avoid public cloud providers to have control over their whole infrastructure, meet regulatory compliance, and offer services without vendor lock-in, in this case **Private Cloud** is the choice.

Finally if the organization wants to scale up or down its applications and having the capacity to go global in minutes without much effort a **Public Cloud** model is the right choice.
