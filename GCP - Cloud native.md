With the advent of cloud computing, we’ve also seen the rise of a new breed of technology company: **cloud-native**. Google Cloud states the following ([https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-native](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-native)):

“Cloud native means adapting to the many new possibilities – but a very different set of architectural constraints – offered by the cloud compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure. Unlike monolithic applications, which must be built, tested, and deployed as a single unit, cloud-native architectures decompose components into loosely coupled services to help manage complexity and improve the speed, agility, and scale of software delivery.”
