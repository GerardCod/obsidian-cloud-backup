When building your infrastructure and managing your data center, you are fundamentally limited by real-world capacity constraints. If you buy land or lease land for a data center, you are constrained by the size of the land, the utility capacity, and the networking infrastructure – essentially limiting how much hardware you can fit onto that land. If you buy a certain number of servers, you are limited by the constraints of the components of that server, such as the motherboard for the amount of CPUs, RAM, and storage that can be attached to that server.

To maximize the cost-performance ratios of on-premises or private infrastructure, companies typically procure data center hardware and software in bulk. Therefore, they make major commitments that impact their ability to adapt to changes in the market and adopt new technologies. For example, if you sign a contract with a hardware manufacturer to procure a specific type of server today, perhaps a new graphics card is launched in a year or two and the hardware on the server may not be able to support that new hardware. Another example would be to procure licenses in bulk for an operating system that may not be needed if the system or application that is being implemented has different requirements.
